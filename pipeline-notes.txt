==========================================
Running the diginorm paper script pipeline
==========================================

:Date: May 21, 2012

Here are some brief notes on how to run the pipeline for our 2012 paper
on digital normalization on an Amazon EC2 rental instance.

The instructions below will reproduce all of the figures in the paper,
and will then compile the paper from scratch using the new figures.

(Note that you can also start with ami-61885608, which has all the
below software installed.)

.. and the EC2 snapshot snap-09d7f173 has all
.. of the data on it.  If you mount that volume and then cp -r everything
.. into /mnt, you will have all the software and files below installed in
.. the right place to run the pipline 'make' near the bottom.)

Starting up a machine and installing software
---------------------------------------------

First, start up an EC2 instance using starcluster::

 starcluster start -o -s 1 -i m2.xlarge -n ami-999d49f0 pipeline

You can also do this via the AWS console; just use ami-999d49f0, and
start an instance with 16gb or more of memory.

Make sure that port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP) are open; you'll need
the first one to log in, and the second one to connect to the ipython
notebook.

Now, log in! ::

 starcluster sshmaster pipeline

(or just ssh in however you would normally do it.)

Once you're logged in, you'll need to install both 'screed' and 'khmer'.
In this case we're going to use the versions tagged for the paper sub.::

 cd /usr/local/share

 git clone git://github.com/ged-lab/screed.git
 cd screed
 git checkout 2012-paper-diginorm
 python setup.py install
 cd ..

 git clone git://github.com/ged-lab/khmer.git
 cd khmer
 git checkout 2012-paper-diginorm
 make test
 cd ..

 echo export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/share/khmer/python >> ~/.bashrc
 echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/khmer/scripts' >> ~/.bashrc
 echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox' >> ~/.bashrc
 source ~/.bashrc

OK, now that these are both built, let's install two other things: the
latest version of ipython notebook (you need 0.13dev, or later)::

 git clone https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git
 cd ipython
 python setup.py install

 pip install -U pyzmq

and bowtie::

 cd /mnt

 curl -L -O http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie/0.12.7/bowtie-0.12.7-linux-x86_64.zip/download
 unzip download
 cp bowtie-0.12.7/bowtie{,-build} /usr/local/bin

Finally, upgrade the latex install with a few recommended packages::

 apt-get install -y texlive-latex-recommended

OK, now all your software is installed, hurrah!

Running the pipeline
--------------------

First, check out the source repository and grab the (...large) initial data
sets::

 git clone https://github.com/ged-lab/2012-paper-diginorm.git
 cd 2012-paper-diginorm

 curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.ged.msu.edu/2012-paper-diginorm/pipeline-data-new.tar.gz
 tar xzf pipeline-data-new.tar.gz

Now go into the pipeline directory and run the pipeline.  This will take
4-8 hours, so you might want to do it in 'screen' (see :doc:`../tutorials-2011/unix_long_jobs`). ::

 cd pipeline
 make KHMER=/usr/local/share/khmer

Once it successfully completes, copy the data over to the ../data/ directory::

 make copydata

Run the ipython notebook server::

 cd ../notebook
 ipython notebook --pylab=inline --no-browser --ip=* --port=80 &

Connect into the ipython notebook (it will be running at 'http://<your EC2 hostname>'); if the above command succeeded but you can't connect in, you probably forgot to enable port 80 on your EC2 firewall.

Once you're connected in, select the 'diginorm' notebook (should be the
only one on the list) and open it.  Once open, go to the 'Cell...' menu
and select 'Run all'.

(Cool, huh?)

Now go back to the command line and execute::

 mv *.pdf ../
 cd ../
 make

and voila, 'diginorm.pdf' will contain the paper with the figures you just
created.
